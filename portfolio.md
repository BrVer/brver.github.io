**SmartPension (Aug 2019 - Dec 2021)**

Fintech project, started in UK but now operating pension savings in multiple countries,<br/>with a dev department > 150ppl in total.<br/>
Most of the time I worked as a team lead in one of the development teams (~10-12ppl),<br/>
responsibilities included:
- working closely with PO and various stakeholders to ensure the common vision and make sure the user stories are of the appropriate quality
- determine/validate technical approach
- take the most complex stories
- align the work with other teams
- ensure the overall quality of the code the team delivers (e.g. reviewing PRs etc., making sure cross-functional requirements are met)
- onboarding new team members
- maintain working processes (or adapt accordingly to the changes in the company/team)

**Fidor (Dec 2017 - Aug 2019)**

Fidor is a German bank,
and I worked on a project to adapt their core banking system for the needs of another, Dutch bank, which required the implementation of a bunch of additional services.<br/>
For a year I worked as a regular software engineer in one of the teams, then another small team of 5ppl started and I was promoted to this team lead.
