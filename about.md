Here I post
- personal notes about some complex tech subjects<br/>(mostly condensed knowledge obtained from bunch of articles),<br/>so it's easier for me to recall it when required
- stuff I know quite well but still find useful for fellow devs

The site is made with Jekyll (using Minimal Mistakes theme), and hosted with Github Pages.
