Inspired by [https://dominicroye.github.io/blog/visualize-urban-growth/](https://dominicroye.github.io/blog/visualize-urban-growth/), 
I decided to visualise and compare various spanish cities maps (and also check how good AI is at doing this job)..

As a result, AI was able to:
- understand the entire required flow
- provide a script in Python
- suggest how to write a similar script for the Basque Country / Navarra (they publish data in a different format)
- refactor the scripts to support data caching and combine multiple data sources for a single image, etc.

So far, I am quite excited about AIâ€™s capabilities!

**Result:**
