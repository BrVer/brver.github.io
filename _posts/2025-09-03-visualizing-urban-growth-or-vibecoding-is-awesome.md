Inspired by [https://dominicroye.github.io/blog/visualize-urban-growth/](https://dominicroye.github.io/blog/visualize-urban-growth/), 
I decided to visualise and compare various spanish cities maps (and also check how good is AI to do this job).

As a result, AI was able to:
- understand the whole required flow
- provide a script in python
- suggest how to write similar script for Basque country / Navarra (they publish data in different format)
- refactor the scripts to support data caching, combining multiple data sources for a single image etc.


So far, I'm pretty hyped with AI capabilities!
